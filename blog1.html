        <h2 class="fw-bold">Peter walking on water to Jesus</h2>
        <br>
        <p>In Matthew 14:22-33 an incredible story unfolds. A storm comes. Jesus walks on water. Peter walks on water, but not quite as well. Peter ends up sinking, and Jesus saves him. </p>
        <p> It's an incredible story. But there's more to the story than just the headlines. If we dig a little deeper, we will find some powerful and practical lessons for our lives today.</p>
        <p> Let's dive into the story of Peter walking on water. </p>
        <br>
        <h5 class="fw-bold">The Setting In Matthew 14:22-33</h5>
        <br>
        <p>Mark and John also record the story of Jesus walking on water. But Matthew's account is unique because it's the only Gospel to record Peter walking on water. This post will focus on Matthew 14:22-33 because it gives us the most details.</p>
        <p>When we read God's Word, it's important always to read it in context. We should read the verses before and after to make sure we fully understand what is happening.</p>
        <p>Immediately before Peter walks on water is the story of Jesus feeding the 5,000 (Matthew 14:13-21). The disciples' faith has to be at an all-time high. They just witnessed a few loaves of bread and fish feed a large crowd.</p>
        <p>Matthew 14:22-23 says after this, Jesus immediately made the disciples get in the boat to go ahead of him to the other side of the sea of Galilee. After this, Jesus dismisses the crowd and goes up a mountainside to pray.</p>
        <p>Later that night, a storm picks up. Matthew records that there were violent waves and strong winds. (Matthew 14:24)</p>
        <br>
        <h5 class="fw-bold">Jesus Walks On Water</h5>
        <br>
        <p>As dawn approaches and the faintest light starts appearing, Jesus decides to go to the disciples. On the still stormy water, Jesus walks on water toward the disciples in the boat, who are still a long way off. (Matthew 14:25)</p>
        <p>The disciples can't tell what or who is walking toward them. They assume it must be a ghost. (Matthew 14:26)</p>
        <p>Knowing their fear, Jesus calls out to them. "Take courage! It is I. Don't be afraid." Matthew 14:27</p>
        <p> Jesus' response to their fear centers on "It is I." These words were a term that Jesus often used to claim deity. In other words, Jesus says the disciples can take courage and fear not because Jesus was there with them.</p>
        <p>Fear is unwarranted where Jesus is present.</p>
        <p>If you were to stop this story after Jesus walks on water, there would be plenty to glean from this passage. But it's not over yet. It's about to get even more interesting.</p>
        <br>
        <h5 class="fw-bold">Peter Walks On Water </h5>
        <br>
        <p>Peter is known for being a little headstrong. He's quick to speak before he thinks things through. And while that got him in trouble from time to time, it also led him to experience things no one else did. </p>
        <p>Simon Peter responds to Jesus, "Lord if it's you, tell me to come to you on the water." (Matthew 14:28) </p>
        <p>Jesus responds with a single word, "Come." </p>
        <p>With remarkable trust and courage, Peter trusts Jesus and climbs over the side of the boat. He steps out in the middle of strong winds and waves. Peter's acts were an incredible display of his faith in Jesus. None of the other disciples dared step foot out of the boat. </p>
        <p>Matthew 14:29 states that Peter walks on water toward Jesus. Those first steps must have been surreal. </p>
        <p> Matthew 14:30 interrupts this incredible moment with a conjunction: but. As Peter walks on water, he notices how powerful the wind and waves are, and he takes his eyes off Jesus. He gets distracted by his harrowing circumstances, and he sinks. Peter's doubt was about to take him out. </p>
        <p>Matthew records his fear as he begins to sink. He must have been terrified. Before he went under, he cried out, "LORD SAVE ME!"</p>
        <p>Jesus doesn't wait. Matthew 14:31 says that Jesus immediately reached out his hand and caught him. After Peter was safe, Jesus rebuked him for his little faith.</p>
        <p>Mark Moore describes the rebuke in his book The Chronological Life Of Christ: "Jesus rebuked Peter for his weak faith even though it was stronger than that of the other disciples who remained in the boat. Jesus used this rebuke to help Peter and the other disciples see that consistent confidence in Him was necessary. Peter became both a good example and a bad one. Jesus rescued him as God had rescued many others from watery graves."</p>
        <p>Still, that's not the last miracle. As Jesus and Peter climbed back into the boat, the wind and waves miraculously calmed. This passage contains three miracles: 1. Jesus walks on water. 2. Peter walks on water. 3. The calming of the storm.</p>
        <p>And yet none of those incredible events is the story's climax. Matthew 14:33 is the climax of this story. It's not the miracles; it's the disciple's worship of Jesus. This is the first time they have addressed Jesus as the Son of God.</p>

        <h3 class="fw-bold">5 Lessons From Peter Walks On Water</h3>
        <br>
        <p>Here are five practical lessons we can pull from Matthew 14:22-33.</p>
        <br>
        <h5 class="fw-bold">1. Peace Is Not Found In The Absence Of The Storm, But In The Presence Of Jesus</h5>
        <br>
        <p>When Jesus bid Peter to come to Him, he didn't calm the storm. Rather, he invited Peter out into the storm, into the rough seas. The rebuke of Peter's lack of faith was because he took his eyes off Jesus and instead focused on the storm.</p>
        <p>We think peace is found when the waves of life are calm. But Jesus never promised us smooth sailing. Instead, he promised to always be with us. Peace is found in the presence of Jesus, even in the middle of a storm. </p>
        <p> Peter's walk on the water teaches us that in the middle of storms, we can have peace IF we keep our eyes on Jesus. The storms of life give us good reasons to be afraid. But Jesus is bigger than even the scariest of storms. </p>
        <br>
        <h5 class="fw-bold">2. Faith Requires Stepping Out Of The Boat </h5>
        <br>
        <p>We like comfort. We like safety. And that's not all a bad thing. But we often need to align our desire for these things more. Sometimes, Jesus will ask you to take a risk and trust him. Sometimes, you have to step out of the boat. </p>
        <p>Just like the apostle Peter, sometimes we will step out of the boat and then be overcome by fear. We will sink. But Jesus is right there to catch you. You might stumble, but you won't drown. </p>
        <p>My guess is the next time Peter "stepped out of the boat," he did so more confidently. His faith and trust in Jesus were greater. The same will be true for you. The more steps of faith you take, the easier it gets. Once you see God's faithfulness, it's easy to trust Him more and more. </p>
        <p>So, step out of the boat. </p>
        <br>
        <h5 class="fw-bold">3. Without Jesus, You Will Sink </h5>
        <br>
        <p> Peter's walk on the water was short-lived. It was short-lived because he took his eyes off Jesus. Peter learned an important lesson that day that we shouldn't ignore. When we take our eyes off Jesus, the storms of life will quickly overcome us. </p>
        <p>When Christians stop looking to Jesus, they quickly sink. They get sucked into temptations. They get overwhelmed by life. They forget who's in control.</p>
        <p>Life is full of storms. Big storms. Storms that will destroy. Unless you keep your eyes on Jesus. With Jesus, you cannot only endure, but you can also walk on water above the storm. Keep your eyes on Jesus. </p>
        <br>
        <h5 class="fw-bold">4. Worship Is Our Response</h5>
        <p> The most important lesson from the Peter walks on water story is our response to the power of Jesus. It's worship.</p>
        <p>When we encounter Jesus, we should worship him. Matthew intentionally highlights this moment because that's the point. This story wasn't about Peter and his faith, or lack thereof. Ultimately it was about the power of Jesus.</p>
        <p>Our response to Jesus Christ should be the same as the disciples. It should bring us to a place of worship when we encounter him. It should remind us of who we are and who He is.</p>
        <br>
        <h5 class="fw-bold">5. When You Follow Jesus, He Will Do Incredible Things Through You</h5>
        <br>
        <p> I'm convinced God wants to tell an incredible story through your life. He wants to do things in you and through you that you can't even imagine. God has walk-on-water moments for you. </p>
        <p>God wants to tell a good story in your life. But often, we settle for boring and safe stories.</p>
        <p>Peter took a risk. He didn't play it safe. </p>
        <p>God wants the same for you. He wants to tell a good story about your life. Will you let him?</p>
