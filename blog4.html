        <h2 class="fw-bold">This Day You Will Be with Me in Paradise (Luke 23:43)</h2>
        <br>
        <p>One of the criminals who hung on the cross hurled insults at Jesus: 'Aren't you the Christ? Save yourself and us!' But the other criminal rebuked him, saying, 'Don't you fear God.' He said, 'We are punished justly, for we are getting what our deeds deserve. But this man has done nothing wrong.'</p>
        <p>Then he said, 'Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom.' Jesus answered him, "Today you will be with me in paradise." (Luke 23:39-43)</p>
        <br>
        <h5 class="fw-bold">Scripture Is Fulfilled</h5>
        <br>
        <p>It is important to realize that Jesus' crucifixion with other criminals was no accident in history. It is a fulfillment of prophecy:</p>
        <p>"He was assigned a grave with the <strong>wicked</strong> and with the rich in his death,
            though he had done no violence, nor was any deceit in his mouth. He poured out his life unto death and was <strong>numbered with the transgressors.</strong>
            For He bore the sin of many and made intercession for the transgressors." (Isaiah 53:9, 12)</p>
        <br>
        <h5 class="fw-bold">Angry Insults from a Dying Criminal</h5>
        <br>
        <p>Hanging on crosses at Jesus' right and left hand are two criminals, Greek kakourgos, "criminal, evil-doer," one who commits gross misdeeds and serious crimes. Other gospel writers use lestes, "robber, highwayman, bandit" (Matthew 27:38; Mark 15:27).</p>
        <p>Though they could have been common thieves, they might have also been the kind of highwaymen described in the Good Samaritan story. The thieves target lonely groups of travelers from Jerusalem to Jericho, strip them of their possessions, and leave them for dead, as in the case of the victim in the Good Samaritan (Luke 10:25-37).</p>
        <p>One of these highwaymen, dying on a cross beside Jesus, taunts Jesus along with the soldiers, "You are the Christ, aren't you? Then save yourself and us!"</p>
        <p>The Thief is making fun of Jesus, acknowledging that he holds the title of The exalted "Messiah," yet he taunts Him. The verb used for describing the Thief's taunts is blasphēmeō, "to speak in a disrespectful way that demeans, denigrates, maligns. Slander, revile, defame."</p>
        <p>The Thief's actions fulfilled the scripture:</p>
        <p>"He was <strong>despised</strong> and <strong>rejected</strong> by men, a man of sorrows and familiar with suffering. Like one from whom men hide their faces, He was <strong>despised</strong>, and we esteemed him not." (Isaiah 53:3)</p>
        <p>"But I am a worm and not a man, <strong>scorned</strong> by men and <strong>despised</strong> by the people. All who see me <strong>mock me</strong>; they <strong>hurl insults</strong>, shaking their heads:</p>
        <p>'He trusts in the LORD; let the LORD rescue him. Let him deliver him since he delights in him.'" (Psalm 22:6-8)</p>
        <p>"Dogs have surrounded me; a band of evil men has encircled me; they have pierced my hands and feet. I can count all my bones; people stare and <strong>gloat over me.</strong> They divide my garments among them and cast lots for my clothing." (Psalm 22:16-18)</p>
        <p>Just below Jesus' feet, the soldiers are casting lots to see who gets his clothing. His last effects aren't given to his family. They go to the soldiers as the "spoils" -- also in fulfillment of Scripture (Psalm 22:18).</p> 
        <br>
        <h5 class="fw-bold">This Man Has Done Nothing Wrong</h5>
        <br>
        <p>One criminal is blaspheming Jesus, but the other is not.</p>
        <p>"The other criminal rebuked him. 'Don't you fear God,' he said, 'since you are under the same sentence? We are punished justly, for we are getting what our deeds deserve. But this man has done nothing wrong.'" (Luke 23:40-41)</p>
        <br>
        <h5 class="fw-bold">Remember Me in Your Kingdom</h5>
        <br>
        <p>"Then he said, 'Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom.'" (Luke 23:42)</p>
        <p>By any measure, this statement is astounding! Jesus' disciples have fled or lingered disillusioned that dark Friday at the margins of the crowd. Their hopelessness is echoed by the men on the road to Emmaus, "... They crucified Him, but we had hoped that he was the one who was going to redeem Israel" (Luke 24:20-21).</p>
        <p>But here on the cross, a fellow condemned man, life ebbing out of him, looks to the center cross and sees not another dying man, but the Messiah himself. Somehow, he understands that Jesus is not an impostor and that he will still receive the Kingdom that belongs to the Messiah.</p>
        <p>I recall Joseph saying something similar to Pharaoh's cupbearer, prisoner to a fellow prisoner when Joseph predicted that the cupbearer would be released from prison: "When all goes well with you, remember me and show me kindness; mention me to Pharaoh and get me out of this prison." (Genesis 40:14)</p>
        <p>How can this quality of faith exist at such a dark time? Already the darkness is falling over the whole land, yet a dying thief believes.</p>
        <p>Did he confess his sins? Yes. "We are punished justly, for we are getting what our deeds deserve" (Luke 23:41). Does he repent? Not verbally, but yes, I think he did. His repentance and hope prompt his plea for Jesus' mercy, "Remember me...."</p>
        <br>
        <h5 class="fw-bold">Is the Thief Saved?</h5>
        <br>
        <p>But was he saved? Jesus commanded baptism. In the more extended ending of Mark's Gospel, Jesus says: "Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved, but whoever does not believe will be condemned" (Mark 16:16). But things don't always follow the prescribed order. At the house of Cornelius, for example, the Holy Spirit falls upon Gentiles who believe the words Peter is saying to them. So Peter baptizes them after the Holy Spirit comes upon them (Acts 10:44-48).</p>
        <p>The key here is faith. The Thief on the Cross believes; his prayer to Jesus is bursting with confidence. He has more faith that day than any other human observing the deep-sorrow scene.</p>
        <p>Paul writes: "For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith -- and this not from yourselves, it is the gift of God -- not by works, so that no one can boast." (Ephesians 2:8-9)</p>
        <p>We could multiply references to the importance of faith, such as, "Whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life. For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.</p>
        <p>For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved" (John 3:15, 36; 6:40), "your faith has saved you" (Luke 7:50), and many others. </p>
        <p>The Thief on the Cross illustrates saving faith that is instructive to us as we seek to understand this mystery of our salvation.</p>
        <br>
        <h5 class="fw-bold">Today You'll Be with Me in Paradise</h5>
        <br>
        <p>"Jesus answered him, 'I tell you the truth, today you will be with me in paradise.'" (Luke 23:43)</p>
        <p>Jesus gives the believing Thief a tremendous promise: presence with Christ in Paradise! Our English word "paradise" is a transliteration of the Greek word paradeisos, which comes from an Old Persian word pairidaeza, "enclosure, garden." In the Greek Septuagint translation of the Old Testament, the word is used especially for the Garden of God or Garden of Eden in the creation story (Genesis 2:8-10, 16, etc.), thus moving the word from the realm of secular parks to the sacred Garden of God himself. Judaism of Jesus' day equated Paradise with the New Jerusalem and saw it as the present abode of the souls of the departed patriarchs, the elect, and the righteous. In the New Testament, the word "paradise" is used three times:</p>
        <p>"Today you will be with me in paradise." (Luke 23:43)</p>
        <p>"And I know that this man -- whether in the body or apart from the body I do not know, but God knows -- was caught up to Paradise. He heard inexpressible things, things that man is not permitted to tell." (2 Corinthians 12:3-4)</p>
        <p>"He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To him who overcomes, I will give the right to eat from the tree of life, which is in the paradise of God." (Revelation 2:7)</p>
        <p>In 2 Corinthians 12:3-4, Paul seems to equate the "third heaven" with Paradise. We can identify Paradise with heaven and be pretty safe. Jesus promises the believing Thief that he will be with Jesus in heaven "today."</p>
        <br>
        <h5 class="fw-bold">Faith and Promise</h5>
        <br>
        <p>Jesus often pointed out when people had "little" or "great" faith. Once Jesus encountered someone with great faith, a Roman centurion, he told Jesus that He didn't need to come to heal his servant physically; all He had to do was speak the word, and He has the authority to have it accomplished (Luke 7:2-10). Jesus is amazed at the man: "I tell you, I have not found such great faith even in Israel" (Luke 7:9).</p>
        <p>The Centurion and the Thief on the cross is an incredible example of faith and confidence in Jesus and God. Neither is acceptable to religion -- one a Gentile, the other a criminal. But each has great faith, and each, I am sure, brings joy to Jesus' heart.</p>
        <p>In closing, the Thief received the sweetest blessing imaginable, which was Jesus' response to his request: "Yes, you'll be with me there -- today in Paradise. We'll go together, you and I."</p>
