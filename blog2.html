        <h2 class="fw-bold">Ruth</h2>
        <br>
        <h5 class="fw-bold">Famine and Tragedy</h5>
        <p>The opening of the Book of Ruth begins with sorrow. When a famine devasted Bethlehem, Naomi and her husband sojourned in Moab, and their two sons took Moabite wives named Ruth and Orpah. But after a decade, the women were left alone when their husbands passed away.</p>
        <p>After hearing of the Lord's faithfulness to his people in the land of Judah, Naomi decided to return there. Ruth and Orpah insisted on accompanying her, but she told them to return to their mothers. Hearing this, Orpah kissed Naomi and left, but Ruth "clung to her," refusing to leave her side:</p>
        <br>
        <p>But Ruth said, "Do not press me to go back and abandon you!</p>
        <br>
        <p>Wherever you go, I will go;</p>
        <p>wherever you lodge, I will lodge.</p>
        <p>Your people shall be my people and your God, my God.</p>
        <p>Where you die, I will die, and there be buried.</p>
        <p>May the Lord do thus to me, and more, if even death separates me from you!"</p>
        <p>– Ruth 1:16</p>
        <br>
        <h5 class="fw-bold">Ruth and Naomi Set Out</h5>
        <br>
        <p>Realizing that Ruth was determined to accompany her, Naomi set out toward Bethlehem. When they arrived in the land, the barley harvest was beginning. Ruth went to glean in the fields of a man named Boaz, who was a relative of Naomi. When he saw Ruth working there, he asked his reapers, "Whose young woman is this?" And they told him that she was a Moabite who had come with Naomi (Ruth 2:5-7).</p>
        <p>Boaz then spoke to Ruth, asking her to stay in his fields and offering protection. Ruth was awed by his kindness, asking what she could have done to earn his favor. He replied:</p>
        <p>"I have had a complete account of what you have done for your mother-in-law after your husband's death; you have left your father and your mother and the land of your birth and have come to a people whom previously you did not know. May the Lord reward what you have done! May you receive a full reward from the Lord, the God of Israel, under whose wings you have come for refuge." – Ruth 2:11-12</p>
        <p>After they spoke, Boaz instructed his other workers to leave extra grain for her to glean.</p>
        <br>
        <h5 class="fw-bold">Naomi Conceives a Plan</h5>
        <br>
        <p>When Ruth returned to her mother-in-law that night, she told her where she had worked in the fields that day. Naomi responded with joy, saying of Boaz:</p>
        <p>"May he be blessed by the Lord, who never fails to show kindness to the living and the dead. This man is a near relative of ours, one of our redeemers." – Ruth 2:19-20</p>
        <p>Then Naomi instructed Ruth to see Boaz on the threshing floor that night. So Ruth did as Naomi bade her to and went down to the threshing floor and uncovered his feet where he lay. Boaz awoke at midnight to see Ruth lying at his feet and was startled:</p>
        <p>"Who are you?" he asked. She replied, "I am your servant Ruth. Spread the wing of your cloak over your servant, for you are a redeemer." He said, "May the Lord bless you, my daughter! You have been even more loyal now than before in not going after the young men, whether poor or rich. Rest assured, my daughter, I will do for you whatever you say; all my townspeople know you to be a worthy woman. Now, I am a redeemer, but there is another redeemer closer than I. Stay where you are for tonight, and tomorrow, if he will act as redeemer for you, good. But if he will not, as the Lord lives, I will do it myself…"- Ruth 3:9-13</p>
        <br>
        <h5 class="fw-bold">Ruth's Redemption </h5>
        <br>
        <p>After this, Boaz spoke to the city's elders, telling them of Naomi's inheritance: a parcel of land from their relative Elimelech. He told the redeemer that he would have the duty of marrying Ruth in taking this land. But the redeemer renounced his claim to the land, so Boaz bought it himself. Then Boaz took Ruth as his wife, and they had a son named Obed.</p>
        <p>Obed was the father of Jesse, who was the father of David, the eventual king of Israel.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h5 class="fw-bold">Lessons from Ruth and Naomi</h5>
        <br>
        <p>The Book of Ruth is a beautiful example of how God can take a hopeless situation and turn it into something glorious. The story begins with tragedy – famine and the deaths of Ruth and Naomi's husbands. But because Ruth is loyal and faithful, God rewards her. Not only is Ruth redeemed by Boaz, but she also becomes an ancestor to the future king of Israel.</p>
        <p>Ruth's heritage is critical in this story: she was a Moabite, a detail frequently reiterated in the book. In Ruth and Naomi's lifetimes, the Israelites looked down upon the Moabites, considering them to be inferior people. In selecting Ruth, God chose one of the "least of these" as the basis for the lineage of not only the future king of Israel but for the Messiah who would save the world. God's choice to include Ruth in the story of divine redemption shows that his grace is for all people and that no person is too insignificant to be used for his glory.</p>
